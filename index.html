      <h1>Joe Spizzandre <br> An Introduction</h1>
      <script src="script.js"></script>
      <p>At 36 years of age I can say that I have learned some things. Most of the truly important lessons having been learned in the last few years of my life. 
        However, those lessons are not to be emparted via a website that is essentially self-promotion. Instead let's talk about a few things that are more entertaining; 
        <a href="#Star-Wars">Star Wars</a>, <a href="#League-of-Legends ">League of Legends</a>, and finally some <a href="#ASMR">shameless self-promotion</a>.</p>

        <p>I love Star Wars. And more importantly I love that this information was commited from a difference source than the above. I'm going to add a bunch 
          here but I need to fill oput some space to ensure my scroll to view javascripting works. This content will be filled in later.

        <h1 id="League-of-Legends"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/e2/be/95e2beeff28cf0ca9a65acc6616c0bd6.png" alt="League Logo" width="600px" height="400px"></h1>
        <p>I owe my love of League to many things; love of competition, fascination with magic, the incredible learning curve that rewards players
          with truly epic moments. But ultimately without my dear friend Mr. B (true name withheld for obvious reasons) I'd never be where I am today. 
          A ten year veteran of the game. While staying with me for a rotation during his medical school years he introduced me to the game. And in a few months
          of grinding and slowly coming to master the basics of the game I was irrevocably hooked. <br><img src="https://www.lolnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rocket-Grab-1024x537.jpg" alt = "Blitzcrank Rocket Grab" width="500px" height="250px"><br>I hold some opinions that 
          differ from the community as whole, specifically that I don't believe the game is that toxic. I experienced very similar things in my years playing Football, 
          lacrosse, and even ultimate frisbee. Competition, and more specifically losing a competition, can have adverse effects on ones psyche. Especially if they haven't 
          been schooled/conditioned in such things. Many of the people playing League do not have traditional sports backgrounds and the toxicity of competition is a new
          experience for them.

        <h1 id="ASMR">Purring Wolverine ASMR</h1>
        <p>ASMR (Auto-sensory meridian response) videos and content was something I stumbled upon years ago. I cannot even remember how or why, but I am happy that 
          I did. In short, ASMR is a series of audio or visual 'triggers' that cause your brain to tingle. For many these triggers include small sounds like tapping on glass, 
          or crinkling paper. I personally trend towards voice-based ASMR, involving both whispering and soft spoken words. While I rarely get tingles myself, I find the content
           to be incredibly relaxing and I listen to ASMR before I sleep nearly every night. 
           In conjunction with my personal love of ASMR I have been told on a number of occasions that I have a voice that would be great for voice-over or audiobook work, DJing, etc.
           While I have always appreciated the compliments it was recently that I've taken to heart some of the more enthusiastic... supporters of my voice and created a channel for 
           my own ASMR content. Without further adeiu, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-v-Az44bcKKbx2o1ioOgQ/videos" target="_blank">A Purring Wolverine</a>. 
           Right the channel is obviously in its infancy. But I am more than open to feedback, suggestions, and any questions you may have! Just leave a comment on any video, I'll
           respond as soon as I can!
