      <p>At 36 years of age I can say that I have learned some things. Most of the truly important lessons having been learned in the last few years of my life. 
        However, those lessons are not to be emparted via a website that is essentially self-promotion. Instead let's talk about a few things that are more entertaining; 
        Star Wars, League of Legends, and finally some shameless self-promotion.</p>
        
        <p id="Star Wars">I love Star Wars. And more importantly I love that this information was commited from a difference source than the above</p>
